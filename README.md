CODEDEX 🧬
A Gamified Skill Verification Platform for Programmers

CODEDEX is a Pokédex-inspired platform that reimagines how programming skills are tracked and represented. Instead of listing technologies or self-claiming proficiency, CODEDEX focuses on actual exposure and usage of language constructs in a structured, visual, and gamified way.

In CODEDEX, each programming language is treated as a region, and every keyword, command, or core concept is a collectible dex entry. Developers “encounter” constructs by learning them and “catch” them by using them in real code. Progress is shown through clear metrics such as Seen vs Used, category completion, and region-level mastery.

The project is designed to highlight depth over breadth. Rather than asking “Do you know Python?”, CODEDEX answers questions like:

How much of the language have you actually used?

Which areas are strong, and which are unexplored?

How does your mastery evolve over time?

The current prototype includes:

Kanto (Python) and Johto (C++) regions

Category-based command tracking

Seen / Used progression system

Visual mastery indicators and stats

A scalable architecture for adding new languages and regions

CODEDEX is built as a frontend-first MVP using React, with a long-term roadmap that includes backend verification, project-based analysis, and AI-assisted skill validation.

This project is not intended to replace portfolios or repositories, but to complement them by providing a structured, transparent view of learning progression and real-world language usage.
